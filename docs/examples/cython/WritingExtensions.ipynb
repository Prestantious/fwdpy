    "# Extending fwdpy with Cython\n",
    "\n",
    "Cython makes it easy to [share definitions](http://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/userguide/sharing_declarations.html) between packages, making it easy to use fwdpy's types to write custom code.  Further, as fwdpy depends on and installs [fwdpp](https://molpopgen.github.io/fwdpp), you get access to many of that library's features.  Even better, you can write your extensions and ignore a lot of gory details regarding compiling and linking--Cython handles that for you!\n",
    "\n",
    "This document serves as a rapid-fire tutorial both to the C++ types that underly fwdpy and how to use Cython to write your own extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plugins vs. packages\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part, Cython code is written in files with the extension .pyx.  If you can write all of your extension in Cython, you may simply compile and import your module into a script using [pyximport](http://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/reference/compilation.html).  For user's familiar with [Rcpp](http://rcpp.org), think of pyimport as the analog to their `sourceCpp` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using pyxbld, the function `fwdpy.make_pyxbld` will help you out a lot--please see its documentation in the reference manual.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you start writing a lot of extensions or your extensions require C++11 features that Cython cannot handle, then you may want to consider writing a full-blown package for your extensions. There are lots of examples online, from the Cython documentation to how the [fwdpy source code](http://github.com/molpopgen/fwdpy) is organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linux vs OS X\n",
    "\n",
    "## An important note\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the example functions below actually end up replicating things that are already doable in fwdpy.  In other words, you don't need any of the stuff below to do what is below.  These are examples for the point of documenting the C++/Cython API that you have access to."
