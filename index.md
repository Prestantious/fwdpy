# The fwdpy home page

This is the homepage for __fwdpy__, which is an Python package for forward-time population- and quantitative- genetic simulations.

## Source code

The source code is [here](https://github.com/molpopgen/fwdpy)

## Documentation

The manual is manually generated by us via a separate project hosted on GitHub.  We are attempting to make sure that the manual is current with the latest stable release of fwdpy, but that won't always be the case.

We are attempting to have it automatically build via [readthedocs](http://readthedocs.org), but that is proving a challenge.

* [Manual](https://molpopgen.github.io/fwdpy_manual/index.html) in html format.

## Examples

Here are some examples generated using [Ipython](http://ipython.org/)/[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/):

* [Background selection](docs/examples/BGS)
* ["Views" of populations](docs/examples/views)
* [Deep copies of simulated populations](docs/examples/copypops)
* [Trajectories of selected mutations](docs/examples/trajectories)
* [Recording from simulations over time](docs/examples/temporalSampling)
* [Distribution of fixation times](docs/examples/FixationTimes1)
* [Sliding windows](docs/examples/windows)

## Advanced examples

These examples use Python's built-in multiprocessing features to run simulations and synchronize writing output from multiple threads:

* [Background selection](docs/examples/advanced/BGSmd)
* [Ages of selected alleles](docs/examples/advanced/SelectedAlleleAges)

## Extending fwdpy

A major goal of __fwdpy__ is to make it extensible, which can be done via Python, Cython, and/or C++.  The Cython option simplifies the use of C++ in writing extensions:
